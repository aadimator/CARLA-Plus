# CARLA+

Welcome to the CARLA+ repository!

CARLA+ is an open-source autonomous driving simulation framework designed for modeling the dynamics of complex urban environments. Leveraging the power of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), CARLA+ provides a robust and flexible platform for simulating autonomous driving scenarios in uncontrolled urban environments.

## Features

- PGM-based modeling: CARLA+ utilizes a probabilistic graphical model to capture the dynamics of complex urban environments.
- Environment dynamics: With CARLA+, you can model various aspects of the environment, such as time of day, weather types, vehicle count, vehicle speeds, pedestrian count, and their interactions.
- Automated behavior: Instead of relying on manual code and conditional statements, CARLA+ allows users to automate the modeling of different dynamics in the simulation environment.
- Enhanced CARLA simulator: CARLA+ is an extension of the classical CARLA simulator, designed to provide more sophisticated settings and capabilities for accurately modeling the required dynamics of complex urban environments.
- Open-source: The code of CARLA+ is made publicly available, encouraging collaboration and research in the field of autonomous driving.

## Installation

To get started with CARLA+, follow the installation instructions provided in the [Installation Guide](docs/installation-guide.md). This will guide you through the process of setting up the simulator environment.

## Usage

Once you have installed CARLA+, refer to the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) for detailed instructions on how to use the simulator and leverage the PGM-based modeling capabilities. The guide provides examples and explanations to help you simulate various scenarios in complex urban environments.

## License

CARLA+ is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE), granting you the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software.
